# Sprsun-PC
Integration of the Sprsun CGKxxxV3L-B heat pump with HA
If anyone needs it, I'm posting a link to the HA configuration for the Sprsun v.B pump (touch panel). This is a development version and I will add the rest as needed and time.
Screenshots of modbus settings for EW11, the app does not work then.
In the pumpa_ciepła.yaml yaml you need to enter the EW11 IP address of the pump.
Automation is needed to change some parameters.
